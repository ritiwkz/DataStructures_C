# Reversing an Array in C++

## Step-by-step explanation

This C++ program reverses the content of an integer array using a function called `reverseArray`. The function takes three parameters: the array to be reversed, and the starting and ending indices of the portion of the array to be reversed.

The function uses a while loop to iterate over the elements of the array, starting from the specified starting index and ending at the specified ending index. Within the loop, the function swaps the values of the elements at the current index and the index that is the same distance from the end of the array. This process continues until the starting index and ending index meet in the middle of the array, at which point the array is fully reversed.

The main function of the program creates an integer array and initializes it with some values. It then calls the `reverseArray` function to reverse the content of the array. Finally, the main function prints the original array and the reversed array to the console.

## Code snippets

Here are the key code snippets from the program:

```c++
// Function to reverse an array using start and end
void reverseArray(int arr[], int start, int end)
{
    while (start < end)
    {
        int temp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

```c++
// Utility Function to Print an Array
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

## Conclusion

This C++ program demonstrates how to reverse the content of an integer array using a function called `reverseArray`. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the elements of the array and swap the values of the elements at the current index and the index that is the same distance from the end of the array. This process continues until the starting index and ending index meet in the middle of the array, at which point the array is fully reversed.
